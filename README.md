# First Kaggle Competition

## Into

The goal of this competition is to predict the sales price for each house in the data set. The data set includes 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. Two other classmates and I grouped up to compete in a competition to come up with the best machine leaning model to predict prices of houses. 

This model was made all in Python using primarily the Scikit-Learn library and some other data visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
Since the competition, I have personally improved the model and have created a new webpage that explains the thought process along with the results.
This can be found on my blog with other machine learning projects and data related projects. https://tim-mccabe.github.io/house_prices.html

## Tasks Performed

In this project was meant to be solved using advanced regression techniques. Data cleaning and visualizing was a huge part of deciding which feature to run the algorithms on. 
Once those features were selected the regression techniques we used included:
  * Linear Regression
  * Lasso Regression
  * Random Forest Regression
  * Gradient Boosting Regression
