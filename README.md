# Final Project

## Into

The goal of this competition is to predict the sales price for each house in the data set. The data set includes 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. Two other classmates and I grouped up to compete in a competition to come up with the best machine leaning model to predict prices of houses. 

This model was made all in Python using primarily the Scikit-Learn library and some other data visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
Since the competition, I have personally improved the model and have created a new webpage that explains the thought process along with the results.
This can be found on my blog with other machine learning projects and data related projects. https://tim-mccabe.github.io/house_prices.html
